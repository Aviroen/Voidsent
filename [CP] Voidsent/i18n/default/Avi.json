 //thursday
 //BETAS
 "BETAS.Avi.Thursday_0": "I think my upbringing on MMOs, jRPGs, and story-driven games are the reason why I wanted my own expansion.",
 "BETAS.Avi.Thursday_1": "You're talking to the 'me' that I've written, isn't that weird?",

 //BETAS
 "BETAS.Avi.Friday_0": "Are you enjoying Voidsent so far?",
 "BETAS.Avi.Friday_1": "I guess it is quite weird for the creator of a mod to not be a tia, but I don't want anyone to romance me.",
 "BETAS.Avi.Friday_2": "Happily married and I don't really care all that much to be likeable by the populace.",
 "BETAS.Avi.Friday_3": "There are always the weirdoes who will probably make a tiaoid version of this NPC, and I will look at them in disgust.$3",
 //daily
 "Avi.Friday_0": "I long for the day where I can sunbathe like my sons.#$b#In front of a window in a sunroom, chores done for the day.#$b#Yet I must toil, working a menial job as I continue my hobbies to keep myself sane.",
 "Avi.Friday_1": "If we look back at the history of my modwork, going from portraits and sprites to a full blown expansion is quite a leap.#$b#I had a lot of fun learning and breaking things in real time.#$b#There's just nothing like seeing your own creation instantly in front of you quite like modwork.",
 "Avi.Friday_2": "At first, Voidsent was going to be a 'Grandberg Lands' expansion, and then I didn't really care to write about real-world war.#$b#Being someone who lives in a war-driven country has made me jaded to it and I felt like I wouldn't do a realistic-war story justice.#$b#That being said, Konryn has his own pitfalls and fallacies that doesn't quite set this as a full blown country-versus-country war.#$b#Civil wars are important, but I wanted to go in depth of the psyche of a character.",
 "Avi.Friday_3": "At first, Kis was going to do the mapwork for all of Voidsent, I was going to commission her so that I could get a grasp of the beautiful farms she's created.#$b#I got impatient, and we now have what we get now.#$b#I'm still quite proud of what I've done so far with my own hands, and it could be better.#$b#But that's for a different time.#$b#And maybe a content update.",

 //saturday
 //BETAS
 "BETAS.Avi.Saturday_0": "Well that was fucking sappy now wasn't it.",
 "BETAS.Avi.Saturday_1": "And no, if someone tries to romance this NPC or my husband's NPC I will be sorely disgusted.",
 "BETAS.Avi.Saturday_2": "You ask why I put them in, then?#$b#Because it's a fun bout of dialogue seeing inside of the house that made this home, isn't it?",
 "BETAS.Avi.Saturday_3": "Peering into the mind of the author and my circumstances, as it is.#$b#If you cared so much to talk to this NPC and realize that I'm a strong fourth wall breaker, maybe this is a breath of fresh air.#$b#Maybe you're offput by the fact that I break the fourth wall so often.#$b#You're free to stop talking to this NPC.#$b#Free will is a thing, after all.",
 //daily
 "Avi.Saturday_0": "My own personal cat is where I, as the author of Voidsent, want to rant about the makings of this entire process as well as the credits given all around.#$b#Consider this the credit roll, a bow out of the actors involved.#$b#If it weren't for the community and its boundless love for the game, I wouldn't have continued this project.#$b#Though they aren't explicitly here, I'd like to thank a few people like Abagaianye, Pixeltica, Spiderbuttons, Mushymato, Rokugin, and the Sunberry team.#$b#Some of them have seen me from the very start of my mod career and seen me go from pool floaties to sky-diving off the top rope within a short amount of time.#$b#There are multitudes of others I'd like to thank but then we'd just be here for forever, wouldn't we?",
 "Avi.Saturday_1": "Even though I gripe about The Mod That Shall Not Be Named, having an entire archive-of-our-own fanfiction dedicated to it made my cold, dead heart, warm again.",
 "Avi.Saturday_2": "Do I care about Voidsent being translated to other languages?#$b#No, not really.#$b#This is something near and dear to my heart that I would like to translate of my own accord, no machine translations to botch the sensibility of the feelings I wanted to get across in English.",
 "Avi.Saturday_3": "Of course, there's always those that want to profit off of the work of others.#$b#Voidsent is a labor of love that I've cared for, for well over a year at this point in July of 2025.",

 //sunday
 //BETAS
 "BETAS.Avi.Sunday_0": "This cat has turned into a mushfest, gross.",
 "BETAS.Avi.Sunday_1": "If you're still listening, good morning, good afternoon, and if I don't see you, good night.",
 "BETAS.Avi.Sunday_2": "It's a wonder you've spoken to the cats this often that you keep coming back for more.",
 "BETAS.Avi.Sunday_3": "Are we actually cats?#$b#No, we're just pixels.#$b#But so are you.",
 //daily
 "Avi.Sunday_0": "And thus, we come to the last bits of dialogue for this cat.#$b#I had a lot of fun making this mod, and I hope you, too, enjoy the experience.#$b#After all, consider this a diary of my own, open to the public to enjoy the sentiments of an author.",
 "Avi.Sunday_1": "Whether you're a friend of mine, some random just downloading this mod and happening upon this cat and going, 'what the actual--'.#$b#There were a lot of mechanics I wanted to play with in my own game of Stardew.#$b#I wanted livelier NPCs, more immersive talking, combat mechanics that were fun but not grating.#$b#I wanted an experience that made me want to keep on playing.#$b#To see if anything could grip me long enough and still come back to it.#$b#I'm still trying, as a writer, I'd like it if people saw my art in all of its forms as inspiring.#$b#Maybe, you, too, could become a mod author.#$b#Please, for the love of god read wikis though.",
 "Avi.Sunday_2": "You might be asking why I just didn't go into a career for game development, the short answer is that I didn't really go to school for it.#$b#The long answer for it is that I don't think I could continue the creative streak if it were my job.",
 "Avi.Sunday_3": "I leave this dialogue open to make a final tally of all of the words written for Voidsent.#$b#My love letter to those lost, a memory of my beloved father, a digital memoir for myself."
